<p>Ricochet poker is a form of poker without bluffing, and with an emphasis on calculating odds and pressing luck.</p>
<p>During a round, all players ante an then receive a portion of their poker hand. The player with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">lowest poker hand</a> either chooses to buy more cards or fold. The player with the best hand at the end of the round wins the pot.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>Each round starts with all players making an ante of 1 chip. Then each player receives 1 card, face up.</p>
<p>The person with the lowest poker hand hand (e.g. lowest card at the start of the round) acts first. Suits are ranked in alphabetical order, from low to high: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.</p>
<h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
<p>On a players turn, they either fold or buy cards.</p>
<p>If a player folds, they step out of the round.</p>
<p>If a player buys cards, they first announce how many they want to buy, and put that many chips in the pot. Players may only buy cards up to a total hand size of 5 cards. The dealer will give the cards, face-up, stopping directly when the hand is not the lowest hand anymore. Note: it can be that the player therefore received fewer cards than bought for.</p>
<p>If a player buys cards and still has the lowest poker hand after receiving their bought cards, that player is out of the round.</p>
<p>Ater every turn the action moves to the player with the lowest hand.</p>
<p>Play continues until there’s 1 player left, or if there is a tie for the best hand.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-ties">Breaking ties</h2>
<p>A hand with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kicker_(poker)">kicker</a> beats a hand without (for example, a King+3 hand beats a hand of a single King, but a King+8 beats a King+3). Suits are used to break ties given identical hands. In the final hand, suits are not used to break ties; only to determine the next player in turn. If at the end of a round 2 or more players are tied, the pot is split.</p>
