# Munipacking through the Highlands

In 2022 and 2024 I backpacked the East Highland Way and Great Glenn Way respectively on my mountain-unicycle.
The [Unicyclist forum thread](https://unicyclist.com/t/riding-east-highland-trail-in-scotland-with-pictures/275533) contains lots of pictures I've made during those tours.
