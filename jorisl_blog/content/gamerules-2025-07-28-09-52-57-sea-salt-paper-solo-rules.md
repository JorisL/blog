# Sea Salt & Paper Solo Rules

_These rules are based on the [solo rules by @EricKenneth](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3382394/dumb-ai-solo-version)._

## Overview

In this solo mode, you play a 2-player game against a bot.
This game consists of a single round, where you can stop the round once you reach 12 points.
The bot's actions are determined by a d6 dice, and this dice also limits the actions on your turn.
The bot does not play cards, but gathers them in a face-down pile. It's score is determined using special scoring rules.

## Setup

1. Place a mermaid card sideways representing the bot. Its cards will be placed right below it.
2. Place a d6 on the mermaid area for now.
3. Place the deck and the two discards as usual to the right of the mermaid's area.

## Special rules

- The player always starts the game.
- Whenever a discard pile is empty, immediately fill it with the top card of the deck.
- The player can't choose to draw from a pile if the dice is on that pile (taking a card from that pile using the crab action is allowed).
- When playing the swimmer-shark combo, shuffle the bot's pile and take a random card.
- When playing the swimmer-jellyfish combo, the bot takes the top card from the draw pile in its turn. The dice does not change position.

## Bot's turn

During the bot's turn:

1. Roll the dice, and put the top card from the corresponding pile face down on the bot's pile.
    - 1 or 2: deck.
    - 3 or 4: first discard pile.
    - 5 or 6: second discard pile.
2. Place the dice on the pile the card was taken from.

## Ending the game

Once the player reaches 12 points, they can choose to end the game.
Then take a final turn for the bot.

## Scoring

Scoring for the player is according to the standard rules (without last-chance scoring).

To count the bot's score:

1. Make as many duo-card pairs as possible, adding sea stars if possible.
2. Count score using the standard rules, also including the mermaid card representing the bot.
3. Add 1 point for every single duo-card.
