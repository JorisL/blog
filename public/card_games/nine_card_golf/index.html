    <h1 id="nine-card-golf">Nine-card Golf</h1>
<p><em>Players draw and discard to minimize the total value of their tableau of 9 cards.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Players: 2+</li>
<li>Prerequisites:</li>
<li>1 deck of cards (52 cards + 2 jokers) per 2-3 players</li>
<li>Something to keep the running score for each player</li>
<li>Play time: 15-20 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is played over 4 rounds, where in each round each player tries to get as few points as possible.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Shuffle all cards (including jokers) and deal out 9 cards face down to each player.
Players arrange their cards in a 3x3 grid, keeping the cards face down.</p>
<p>Place the remaining cards as a draw pile in the center of the table, and flip over 1 card to start the discard pile.</p>
<p>Choose a player to start the first round.
On subsequent rounds, the player who scored the most points in the prior round is the starting player.</p>
<p>Each player flips over 3 cars of their choosing in their grid, without looking at the other cards.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>A player chooses one of the following actions in their turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw and look at the top card of the draw pile. The player then chooses either to:</li>
<li>Replacing one of their grid cards with the drawn card, discarding the replaced card.</li>
<li>Discarding the drawn card, after which the player may choose to flip one of the face-down cards in their grid.</li>
<li>Replace one of their grid cards with the top card of the discard pile, discarding the replaced card.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either a face-down or face-up card can be replaced, but the new card is alwasy played face-up.
Discarded cards are always placed face-up on top of the discard pile.</p>
<p>When a player reveals all cards in their grid, all other players get 1 additional turn, after which the round is scored.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>Each player first flips over their face-down cards, if still remaining.
Then each player scores using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aces are worth 1 point.</li>
<li>Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face-value.</li>
<li>Jacks and Queens are worth 10 points.</li>
<li>Kings are worth 0 points.</li>
<li>
<p>Jokers are worth -2 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a card is orthagonally adjacent with a card of the same value, it scores 0 points instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of 4 same-valued cards in a 2x2 block score -10 ponts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player who ended the round (first to reveal all cards in their grid) did not get the lowest score this round, they get a +10 point penalty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Players keep a running cound of their scores over multiple rounds.
The player with the lowest total score wins.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
<p>As with most classic card games, there are many variants of the card game Golf, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game)">Wikipedia</a>.
Nine-card golf, using rules as explaned on this page, is my preferred wat to play.</p>
<p>In my opinion this game works bests as a 2-player game, because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed of play.</li>
<li>High importance to not only care for your own grid, but also to prevent throwing away cards the opponent can use.</li>
<li>The use of a single-card deck causes fewer opportunities making sets of cards, leading to more strategic decisions and less chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204135/skyjo">Skyjo</a> is a modern implementation of the Golf family of card games, suitable for 2-5 players.</p>
