Le Truc is a small bluffing & trick taking game where players (or teams) race to 16 points.

# Gameplay

At the start of each round the dealer deals 3 cards to each player.
The leader of the first trick is the player left of the dealer.
The leader of the first trick may propose, after cards have been dealt, a redeal.
If the dealer agrees the hand is redealt.

Each trick, the leader plays a card, with the other players following in clockwise order.
Unlike most trick taking games, Le Truc is suitless.
Therefore a player can play any card and the highest card wins, irrigardless of suit.
The winner of a trick starts the next trick.

Before playing a card, that player can increase the bet, see [[Betting]] below.
This may be done before playing their first card.

If the highest cards are tied, no one wins the trick.

A player or team wins the round when they win the majority of tricks.
If a player or team wins the first 2 tricks, the 3rd trick is not played out, and all remaining cards are shuffled back into the deck without reveal to the other players.
If both players or teams win the same number of tricks, then no points are scored this round.

# Betting

By default, each round is worth 1 point.

Before a player plays their card they are allowed to double the current value of the round.
If the other player or team accept the point value of the round is doubled (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16).
If the other player or team declines, the player offering to double scores the current game worth, and the round ends immediately (returning all left over cards to the deck without reveal).

Once a bet has been accepted in a round, only the player or team who accepted the last bet that round can offer to double again.

Note: these betting rules are similar to those from the doubling cube in [Backgammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon).

# Team play

When playing in teams, the parners sit opposite of each other.

Open comminucation between team members is allowed, as long as it can also be heard by the opposing team.
